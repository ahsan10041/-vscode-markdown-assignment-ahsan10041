Exporting Markdown file as PDF
------------------------------
In order to convert your '.md' file to PDF format, right click on the preview window on the side, select `Chrome (Puppeteer)` button and from the drop-down menu select PDF. 

This will create a `.pdf` file in the same path as your `.md` file. A screenshot below is attached to demonstrate this process.
